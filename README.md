# Ansible_SD-WAN_02

This is a code get from digital-learning of Cisco webpage

The goal of this task is to build a reboot history report. A GET request using the uri module will be made to the API to collect reboot history and specific data will be collected to make a report using the template module. Since a report table will be created, Jinja2 template will need to be created for this task. Towards the end of the task, tags will be used to better organize and give more control on what tasks to run rather than all of them at once every time the playbook is executed.
